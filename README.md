- Ensure that all the abovementioned dependencies are installed for your default python installation
- Navigate to the src directory
- run "python q1_display.py" (prepending "python" may be important on systems with multiple installed versions, as there may be a discrepancy between the path to which the "python" command maps to, and the path of the default program used to execute ".py" files)
